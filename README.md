# LHL-Capstone-Project
The main agenda of this project is to understand the World economic indicators and figure out which are the Top GDP countries in the world.
Started the EDA with Top 10 countries for the past 25 years.
However, I have downsized the number of years to last 5 years and the sample size to even smaller.
